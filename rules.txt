Blackjack is a popular card game that is played in casinos around the world. 
The objective of the game is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
In a basic game of blackjack, there are typically one to eight decks of playing cards, and each card has a point value:

Number cards 2-10 are worth their face value
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points each
Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is better for the hand

At the beginning of the game, the dealer will deal two cards to each player and one card to themselves. 
The players' cards are dealt face up, while the dealer's first card is dealt face down (the hole card) and the second card is dealt face up. 
The players will then decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). 
The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

If a player's hand goes over 21, they "bust" and lose their bet. 
If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, the player wins their bet. 
If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than the player's hand, the player loses their bet. 
If the player's hand and the dealer's hand have the same value, it is a "push" and the player neither wins nor loses.
If the dealer's hand goes over 21, they bust and all players who did not bust win their bets.

In this variation of the game, the dealer is be required to hit until their hand value is at least 17.
